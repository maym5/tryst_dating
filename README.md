# rendezvous_beta_v3

A dating app that allows its users to rate potential matches and generates a date idea every time users match. Built with the flutter sdk, the app uses 
cloud firestore for its back-end. For those reading this, thanks for checking out the project (make sure to check out the app!), I hope you enjoy browsing
the code as much as I enjoyed writing it.
