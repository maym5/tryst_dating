# tryst_dating

A dating app that allows its users to rate potential matches and generates a date idea every time users match. Built with the flutter sdk, the app uses 
firebase for its back-end, and the google places API provides venue-level data for date suggestions. For those reading this, thanks for checking out 
the project (make sure to check out the app!), I hope you enjoy browsing the code as much as I enjoyed writing it.
